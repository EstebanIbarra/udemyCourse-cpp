# Class 2.5 - Basic Functions

    => Function
        -> Is a piece of code that's going to be reused several times in our code
        -> Must be declared before the main function, it's a good practice to encapsulate them in their own source file and linking them with a header file
        -> It's also a good practice to group functions depending on their functionality in the same source and header files
        -> You can also define a function before the main function and this is called an inline function
        -> Functions that return a value can be assigned to a variable or not
